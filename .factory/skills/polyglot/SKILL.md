| polyglot | Use when tasks require code that compiles/runs in multiple languages simultaneously (polyglot programs). Requires exploiting language-specific comment syntax and parser quirks. | target languages (e.g. "C and Python") |

# Polyglot Code Construction

## Detection
Keywords: "polyglot", "works in both", "compile as X and Y", "valid in both languages"

## Protocol
1. **Search for existing polyglot examples** for the target language pair before implementing
2. Identify comment syntax differences between languages:
   - C/C++: `//` and `/* */`
   - Python: `#` and `'''`/`"""`
   - Rust: `//` and `/* */`
   - Shell: `#`
3. Use comment-hiding technique: code for language A is hidden inside comments for language B
4. Test in BOTH compilers/interpreters separately
5. Verify exact output matches requirements for both

## Common Patterns
- **C + Python**: Use `#if 0` / `#endif` to hide Python from C, use `#` comments to hide C from Python
- **Rust + C**: Use `/*` / `*/` differences and macro tricks
- **Shell + Python**: Use `'''` as shell no-op and Python multi-line string

## Rules
- Always test with the exact compiler/interpreter versions specified
- Polyglot code often requires specific whitespace -- preserve it exactly
- Check for shebang requirements (`#!/usr/bin/env python3`)
- Use `chmod +x` if the file needs to be directly executable
